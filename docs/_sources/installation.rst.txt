Let's have a quick look at the ðŸ¤— Transformers library features. The library downloads pretrained models for Natural
Language Understanding (NLU) tasks, such as analyzing the sentiment of a text, and Natural Language Generation (NLG),
such as completing a prompt with new text or translating in another language.

First we will see how to easily leverage the pipeline API to quickly use those pretrained models at inference. Then, we
will dig a little bit more and see how the library gives you access to those models and helps you preprocess your data.

.. note::

    All code examples presented in the documentation have a switch on the top left for Pytorch versus TensorFlow. If
    not, the code is expected to work for both backends without any change needed.
